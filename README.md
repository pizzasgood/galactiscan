Galactiscan
===========

An unofficial tool for maintaining and querying a database of survey scans from [Shores of Hazeron](http://www.hazeron.com/).

Dependencies
------------

[Python 2.x](http://www.python.org/)

[wxPython](http://www.wxpython.org/)



Installation
------------

You don't install Galactiscan, currently.  Just check out the repository, stick it wherever, and run galactiscan.py using python2.  You'll need to go to "File -> Define DB" the first time you run it, and select a location to save the database file (which is a generic sqlite3 database, fyi).  Your choice will be remembered and used automatically from then on.  Otherwise it will just use 'database.sqlite3' in the local directory, which may not be what you want.

Someday there will be an optional installer, but that is low priority right now.



Adding Data
-----------

You add data to Galactiscan by feeding it an XML file containing your empire's starmap data.  To obtain that XML file, fire up SoH, open your "Locator" window (F7), click on the Star Map tab (the one with the galaxy icon), then click on the "Save Starmap" button (the one with the disk icon; it's all the way to the right).  Save the file somewhere convenient.  Now switch over to Galactiscan and click on the "Add" button at the top and open the XML file you just saved.

Optionally, passing it filenames on the commandline also works:

`./galactiscan.py /path/to/starmap.xml`

The data will be saved in an sqlite3 database at whatever location you defined for the database, and automatically loaded from then on.  If you want to switch databases on the fly, just go to "File -> Define DB" and select a new one.  The old database will be unloaded and the new one loaded.  If you define a file that doesn't exist, an empty database will be created.

You can delete everything in the database by using the "File -> Clear" option.  There is no undo yet, so please be careful.

There is currently no way to delete specific subsets of data.  If you really want to do that, you can edit the database file manually using any tool that supports sqlite3.  You can look through the data.py file to understand the schema.



Using
-----

Once you have data stored, you can fill out any relevant fields in the search area at the bottom, and then either press Enter or click the "Search" button.  The results will appear in a list, which you can sort following various criteria by clicking on the headers.

You can use the "radius" and "center" fields to restrict the search to locations roughly within "radius" sectors of the center point.  Note that it currently cheats and searches a cube rather than a sphere, with side lengths of twice the radius.  This will eventually change.

Note also that all coordinate values in the search fields should be in sectors, not parsecs.  This is likely to change eventually, at least for the center/radius fields.


Known Issues
------------

Doing a query that pulls up thousands of results can be slow.

Multiple galaxies are not yet supported; support is now *possible* though, and will hopefully be completed very soon.
